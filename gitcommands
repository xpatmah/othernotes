Git Rebase-
==========

When We Rebase the feature branch where it has been branched 

master   M1 -> M2 -> M3
               |
feature        M2-> F1-> F2 

after below command feature branch will have new structure 

@ > git rebase master 

master   M1 -> M2 -> M3
                     |
feature              M3-> F1-> F2 


When We Rebase the master branch with feature branch 
initial structure 
master   M1 -> M2 -> M3
               |
feature        M2-> F1-> F2 

@ > git rebase master

master   M1 -> M2 -> M3->F1->F2
                     |
feature              M3-> F1-> F2
