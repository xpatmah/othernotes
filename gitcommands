-- We are in the master branch now 

git branch 

feature/xyz
*master

-- we want to merge the feature brach into master the below command wound not automatically merge 
-- it will only create the a new section in the master that will have the changes and commit and we need to commit that merge section

git merge --squash feature

commiting the merged section 

git commit -m "feature and master branch merged" 


Git Rebase-
==========

When We Rebase the feature branch where it has been branched 

master   M1 -> M2 -> M3
               |
feature        M2-> F1-> F2 

after below command feature branch will have new structure 

@ > git rebase master 

master   M1 -> M2 -> M3
                     |
feature              M3-> F1-> F2 
Note -> Then you have to push changes to remote using git push

When We Rebase the master branch with feature branch 
initial structure 
master   M1 -> M2 -> M3
               |
feature        M2-> F1-> F2 

@ > git rebase feature

master   M1 -> M2 ->F1->F2->M3
               | 
feature        M2-> F1-> F2  (Feature brach will still the same)

Note -> Then you have to push changes to remote using git push

Moving the files 

git mv file_from file_to
and it works fine. In fact, if you run something like this and look at the status, youâ€™ll see that Git considers it a renamed file:

$ git mv README.md README
$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)

    renamed:    README.md -> README
However, this is equivalent to running something like this:

$ mv README.md README
$ git rm README.md
$ git add README

Deleting the local branch

>git branch -d feature

deleting the remote branch

>git push https://github.com/xpatmah/oracledb.git --delete feature

$ git rm -r --cached .  # .for all files in diractory and use file name isteed of . to get out of commited area 
$ git add .  # . for all files in diractory and use file name isteed of . to get in the commited area 
$ git commit -m "Clean up ignored files"
